## Quick Start
* <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/nguwijy/deep_branching_with_domain/blob/main/notebooks/index.ipynb"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg" alt="Render nbviewer" /></a>

* [github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/nguwijy/deep_branching_with_domain/blob/main/notebooks/index.ipynb) also works but it's not ideal: it's slower, the math equations are not always displayed correctly, and large notebooks often fail to open.
